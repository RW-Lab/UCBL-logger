## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.29
This version resolves a critical runtime error in the enhanced EKS logger where the `end_trace()` method was being called with a `metadata` parameter that wasn't properly handled. The fix ensures backward compatibility while adding support for trace metadata.

### Version 1.0.22
Major release introducing the Enhanced EKS Logger with enterprise-grade features for Kubernetes deployments. This version provides comprehensive observability, performance monitoring, and cost optimization features specifically designed for containerized applications.

### Version 1.0.0
Initial stable release providing core user-centric behavior logging capabilities with structured logging, task tracking, and behavioral analysis features.

## Migration Guide

### From 1.0.22 to 1.0.29
No breaking changes. The `end_trace()` method now properly supports the `metadata` parameter as documented.

### From 1.0.0 to 1.0.22
The enhanced EKS features are optional and backward compatible. Existing code will continue to work unchanged. To use enhanced features:

```python
# Old way (still works)
from ucbl_logger import UCBLLogger
logger = UCBLLogger()

# New enhanced way
from ucbl_logger.enhanced import EnhancedEKSLogger
logger = EnhancedEKSLogger(service_name="my-service")
```
