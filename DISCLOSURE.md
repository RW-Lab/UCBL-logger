# UCBLLogger Enhanced EKS - Release Disclosure

## 🚀 First Major Release - v1.0.0

This is the **first major release** of the Enhanced UCBLLogger with EKS optimization features. While we have extensively tested the core functionality and enhanced features, we recognize that real-world usage may reveal edge cases, integration challenges, or opportunities for improvement that weren't covered in our initial testing.

## 🔍 What This Means

### ✅ What's Stable
- **Core UCBLLogger functionality** - Fully backward compatible with existing implementations
- **Basic EKS integration** - Kubernetes metadata collection and CloudWatch delivery
- **Configuration system** - Environment-based configuration and validation
- **Security features** - Data redaction and security monitoring
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

### ⚠️ What May Need Refinement
- **Performance optimization** under extreme load conditions (>10,000 logs/second)
- **Edge case handling** in complex Kubernetes environments
- **Integration compatibility** with specific third-party tools or custom setups
- **Resource usage patterns** in diverse EKS cluster configurations
- **Advanced sampling algorithms** under unusual traffic patterns
